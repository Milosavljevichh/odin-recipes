# odin-recipes

I've been learning HTML and CSS for a while, both as a hobby and for personal needs.
I recently discovered "The Odin Project", a computer science education resource
and I'm following it's lessons step by step, coding even the most
simple lessons that I already have a strong knowledge about.
My goal is to expand my experience and to gain new and effective
ways to write my code.
