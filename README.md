# ODIN-RECIPES

## some background

I've been learning HTML and CSS for a while, both as a hobby and for personal needs. I recently discovered "The Odin Project", a computer science education resource and I'm following it's lessons step by step, coding even the most simple lessons that I already have a strong knowledge about. My goal is to expand my experience and to gain new and effectiveways to write my code.
